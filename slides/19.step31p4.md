- Nothing ground breaking yet.
- You will notice that I've added an extra require statement at the top beyond
  the expected active_support/inflector.
  - This is to support bringing rust code in which we'll see more of in the next
    slide.
- I've implemented the snake case and camel case ruby methods and as we'll see
  next I've also implemented the stubs for the Rust methods.
