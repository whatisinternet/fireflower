## Create a RubyGem

#### lib/fireflower.rb

```ruby
require "fireflower/version"

module Fireflower
  # Your code goes here...
end
```

- Now onto lib
  - Again, all generated code at the moment. This is exactly what you get by
    default in a gem.
- Next up is actually setting up the gem for Rust.
