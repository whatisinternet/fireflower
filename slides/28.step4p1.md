## Run some tests and benchmarks

```shell
git stash
git checkout step4
bundle install
```

- We already have a bunch of tests. You might even notice that we have benchmark
  tests that specify how much faster our Rust implementation is vs the Ruby
  implementation.
- Snake case is about 30 times faster in Rust vs Ruby
- Camel case is about 10 times faster than in Ruby
- Obviously this is a trivial example as we're not really using the full power
  of Rust, and it is trivial to write Rust code that will perform worse than
  equal Ruby code. For an example see https://github.com/whatisinternet/inflector/issues/18
