- Both `to_snake_case` and `to_camel_case` are going to use Rust. You'll
  probably notice that I've left `_to_camel_case` unimplemented. That's what
  we're going to implement
- Next is some glue code from the thermite README
  - The first line is just some ruby to get the top level directory
  - The second line glues the rust code together, running init_fireflower from
    `src/lib.rs` which we'll see next.
