## Mix in some pre-written Rust
#### src/lib.rs

```diff
+extern crate inflector;
+use inflector::Inflector;
```

???

- lib.rs! We're starting to see some Rust code in action!
- Line 1 is very similar in effect to `require` in Ruby. At this point we've told
  Rust that we intend to use the inflector crate somewhere and the compiler will
  now error if we fail to use it as we have enabled the `unused_external_crates`
  warning
- Line 2 is slightly more interesting.
  - Rust has the concept of [`traits`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/traits.html)
    - "A trait is a language feature that tells the Rust compiler about
      functionality a type must provide." -- Rust book
    - In this case we're going to be using inflectors::Inflector trait which
      implements a number of features on both of Rusts string types (&str
      and String).
    - let's have a look at the Rust documentation here as it give a concrete
      example. [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/traits.html)
