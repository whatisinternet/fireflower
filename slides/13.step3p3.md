## Write some ruby

- Time to actually write Ruby!
  - You may want to uncomment this from the gemspec
    ```ruby
    spec.add_dependency "activesupport", "~> 5.0.1"
    ```

  - And this in lib/case.rb
    ```ruby
    require 'active_support/inflector'
    ```

  - Then in vagrant run the following
    ```shell
    bundle install
    ```

???

- This part is optional: If you feel that your can write an effective string to
  `snake_case` without ActiveSupport go for it!
- Your actual code will live in lib/case.rb
- Let's open that now.
