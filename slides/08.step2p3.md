## Rake and gemspec

- Rake file and ext/Rakefile now have boilerplate code for [Thermite](https://github.com/malept/thermite)
- `fireflower.gemspec` now has a runtime dependency!

???
- The code for these three files is directly from the thermite documentation.
- In the rakefile we require in the thermite rake tasks and override default
  with the one from thermite
- ext/Rakefile is very similar.
  - We tell thermite where to find our rust and where to find our ruby and
    thermite takes care of meshing them together!
- The gemspec file additions are straightforward as well.
  - The most interesting part is the new `runtime` dependency.
  - We add thermite so that we can use its included rake tasks and glue code
