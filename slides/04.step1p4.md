## Create a RubyGem

#### spec/fireflower_spec.rb

```ruby
require 'spec_helper'

describe Fireflower do
  it 'has a version number' do
    expect(Fireflower::VERSION).not_to be nil
  end

  it 'does something useful' do
    expect(false).to eq(true)
  end
end
```

- Next up is spec
  - Everything here is generated code at the moment. Notice that
    fireflower_spec just checks that we have a version number and has a failing
    test.
