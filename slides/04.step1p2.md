## Create a RubyGem

#### Gemfile

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'

# Specify your gem's dependencies in fireflower.gemspec
gemspec
```

- Let's take a look into the Gem then gemspec file
  - Notice that the Gemfile is mostly empty, but references the gemspec.
  - Maybe we should actually look in the gemspec
