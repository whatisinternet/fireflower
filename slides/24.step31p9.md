## Mix in some pre-written Rust
#### src/lib.rs

```diff
+#[no_mangle]
+pub extern "C" fn init_fireflower() {
+    Class::from_existing("Case").define(|itself| {
+        itself.def("_to_snake_case", to_snake_case);
+        // itself.def("_to_camel_case", to_camel_case);
+    });
+}
```

- This is the last part before it's up to you to implement to_camel_case
- Starting top down:
  - First we tell the compiler that the method we're about to write should not
    be mangled to permit usage with FFI.
  - Now we define a public method with the `pub` keyword.
    - We define that the method will be externally available from our crate, and
      that the signature should be compatible with C.
    - Finally in the second line, we see a method that only produces side
      effects
      and has an arity of 0.
  - Next up is the DSL used by ruru for exporting classes and methods on those
    classes. Essentially this will export from an existing class called `Case`
the
    function `_to_snake_case`.
  - Notice that define has a somewhat familiar syntax. `|itself| {` is analogous
    to the Ruby block signature `foo do |bar|`.
  - The last note here is that `//` defines a comment in Rust.
