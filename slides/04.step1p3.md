- Nearly everything here is also generated and may or may not pull from your
  dotfiles for author and email.
- If we want to add a new gem as a dependency of this gem we can do so at
  the
  bottom.
- For our purposes it's not important to have an deep understanding of the
  structure of a gem. Anything that we might want to add is already added in
  later steps.
