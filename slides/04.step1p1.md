## Create a RubyGem

```shell
git checkout step1
```


???

- OK job done! I've already created the gem in this case.
- We can take a quick peek into the bits that make up a RubyGem:
  - The majority of what you see in the root directory is created by bundler
    when you create a gem for the first time.
- Let's take a look into the Gem then gemspec file
  - Notice that the Gemfile is mostly empty, but references the gemspec.
  - Maybe we should actually look in the gemspec
    - Nearly everything here is also generated and may or may not pull from your
      dotfiles for author and email.
    - If we want to add a new gem as a dependency of this gem we can do so at
      the
      bottom.
    - For our purposes it's not important to have an deep understanding of the
      structure of a gem. Anything that we might want to add is already added in
      later steps.
- Next up is spec
  - Everything here is generated code at the moment. Notice that
    fireflower_spec just checks that we have a version number and has a failing
    test.
- Now onto lib
  - Again, all generated code at the moment. This is exactly what you get by
    default in a gem.
- Next up is actually setting up the gem for Rust.
