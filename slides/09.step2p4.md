- Our first real Rust code!
- Good news? This is valid Rust
- Bad news? It won't compile
- Let's unpack why:
  - The first line is an attribute
    - Docs: https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/book/attributes.html
  - It's a little special though. We're actually telling the Rust compiler to be
    even more strict than usual.
    - This is similar to Magic comments in Ruby
      - Some docs: http://idiosyncratic-ruby.com/58-magic-instructions.html
    - The idea is we want our Rust code to be clean, stable, and fast. These are
      some of the real `lints` that I use on my projects. At the minimum however
      I would recommend having the deny warnings flag always on. There are
      drawbacks but they're fairly minor in this case.
    - Thus our Rust code will fail to compile because we're not using ruru yet.
  - Next up is another attribute and then a line that is roughly speaking a
    require.
    - Without going into too much detail, macros are part of Rust meta
      programming. However, in Rust you need to be explicit about any macros
      that you're going to import. This attribute is required in this case as we
      plan to use the macros, however the attribute is only required if you plan to
      use them
- We did it! We're on to writing code!
