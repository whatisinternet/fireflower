## Mix in some pre-written Rust
#### src/lib.rs

```diff
+use ruru::{Class, Object, RString};
```

???

- Now we're going to perform a qualified import of three Types from ruru which
  will help us talk to Ruby
- Since Rust &str and String are not strictly compatible with Ruby strings ruru
  provides a way to ensure we can talk back and forth.
- Also since Rust has no concept of Class or Object as it's not an object
  oriented language we import some glue from ruru again.
