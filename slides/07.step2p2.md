[package.metadata.thermite]

[lib]

crate-type = ["dylib"]

[dependencies]
ruru = "0.9"
```

- This is roughly your gemspec or Gemfile but for Rust!
- First up is the package information, which is very basic in this case. For a
  more complex example have a look at the Cargo file for diesel.rs
- Next is actually a specific annotation for thermite. It's required to build
  the project with thermite which is a rake task for generating Rust-based Ruby
  extensions
- We then move onto defining the crate-type. Normally in Rust this field
  wouldn't be required unless you specifically need to specify. In this case we
  do for thermite and ruru (the other rust requirement) to function correctly.
- And finally we're on to the actual dependencies!
- What is ruru?
  - An easy* way to integrate Rust with Ruby using native Ruby
