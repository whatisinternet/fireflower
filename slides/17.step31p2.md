- Only one change here:
  - We're adding a string inflection library to add `to_snake_case` and
    `to_camel_case`
  - I wrote this library and it's available on github.com/whatisinternet/Inflector
  - In this case we're saying "I need Inflector and I don't care what version I
    use".
    - This is not generally a good idea
    - I'd push for specifying a version that you know works as we see with `ruru`
    - In this case however it's safe since we're just doing a demo
