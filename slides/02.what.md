- Rust was developed in house at Mozilla
- Generally thought of as a "systems" programming language like C or C++
- It's compiled using the Rust compiler and LLVM
- It's statically typed, but allows for type inference.
  - This basically means you don't always need to tell the compiler what type
    something is. The compiler is `smart` enough to `know` what the type should
    be in most cases
